# modmail-simple-plugins

A small collection of my [ModMail](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail) plugins.
- `tagging`: Add a `?tag` command to add a header to the thread channel name.
- `reply_cooldown`: Make sure that the same answer can't be sent more than once per five seconds, to avoid double sends.
